          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>After sifting through the data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,
            I discovered a positive correlation between between state poverty levels and the healthcare coverage of the
            state's citizens.  The data shows that the higher poverty level of the state the lower the percentage of 
          healthcare coverage.</p>

          <p>Two states standout on both ends of the spectrum: Texas and Massachusetts.  According to the data, Texas has
            the highest number of people without healthcare coverage.  This is primarily due to Texas being one of eighteen
            states who that currently turn down federal dollars to help people who donâ€™t qualify for subsidies to buy 
            a private plan under the ACA and also aren't eligible for Medicaid under their state's rule.  In 2006, Massachusetts passed a healthcare reform law in 2006 with the aim of providing health insurance to nearly all of its residents. </p>
